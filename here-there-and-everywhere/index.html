We've gotten a taste for the Central European life and we like it. However, there are things that we've noticed already that we will have to get used to. First off, the heat is so oppressive that I barely want to move. I know this isn't really all that different from normal but at least now I have an excuse for it, right? With each day we've been here being hotter than the last, would that mean that today was again the worst of the worst? Correct! It was 32 celsius today and when you are staying in an apartment with no air conditioning it means you get the heck outta dodge for the day and find somewhere to stay cool. At least that's what smart people would do. We decided to try a different route and book a whole bunch of apartment viewings all over the city using only bikes to get around with, 'cause y'know, what's a better way to impress your new landlords than by showing up looking like sweaty messes? Oh, and we also decided to throw a trip to a government building to pick up our work permits as well.</p><p>The day started, as they have been recently, with me waking up in a pool of my own sweat. Making my way downstairs to eat breakfast with Rae and then to plan our day. We knew that it was going to be extra hot today so we wanted to get started early; make sure that we beat the worst of the heat if we can. The first part of the plan was to pick up our work permits. We thought this would be the easy part...we were very wrong. This is where we got introduced to Slovenian bureaucracy. Three times we showed up to our location expecting it to be the correct one, and three times we were sent on to a new location. Eventually we gave up and resolved to try again tomorrow as we had apartment viewings coming up.</p><p>Our apartment viewings started at 2pm in the very northwest portion of the city, a distance of 9km with little shade. It went way faster than expected and the apartment was quite decent, however, it was far out of the way. 9km back into the center of the city for our next viewing at 3:30 and we were starting to get a bit tired. This carried on throughout the day with a viewing here, a bit of downtime to bike, and then another viewing there. All told, I'm sure we biked 40-50km today, which isn't a lot for people used to that I'm sure, but for us it was more than enough and I can't imagine the calories burned with the amount of sweat lost and peddling done. All I can say, is that by the end of this year my legs better look KILLER and leg day will never be an issue again!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c57e26c5-8fa8-454a-ae62-6d93e6bfc105.jpg" title="NOTE: Legs may or may not belong to author"><p><strong>Helping Hands</strong></p><p>We have been blessed with having some amazing hosts at our first AirBNB and I can't recommend them enough if you're ever out this way. Please, if you do decide to come to Slovenia and are in need of a place to stay in Ljubljana let me know and I'll connect you with them. They have gone above and beyond to make sure that we have had the assistance needed to get around, set up bookings for us (since we don't yet have a phone to call with), and have a drink with us in the evening in their garden. We feel like we have made our first friends here in Slovenia and it is awesome! Multiple nights now we have been invited to their garden in the backyard to sit, drink, talk and just generally be merry and it has been a welcome time that leaves us refreshed for the next day.</p><picture>

<p><strong>The Beauty of LJ</strong></p><p>We've had a number of chances now between trying to find our apartment, get our work permits in order, other random things, to take some time and head down and enjoy the city. Just walking around it makes me realize what an amazing privilege it is to be able to do what we are doing and as we sat on the bank of the Ljubljanica river today we snapped this picture on Rae's phone. There are so many amazing sites in this city and country like this and much more beautiful as well. I can't wait to explore them and see what the rest of the year brings for us. Some examples include:</p><p>- A movie night within the old castle walls. The movie is done under the stars and every night is a different movie. Tonight was The Jungle Book, which we originally planned on attending but couldn't for other reasons. In 2 days it's Star Wars so I may have to geek out a bit and go without Raeleen for that one, haha.</p><p>- Iski Vintgar - A canyon just south of the city where everyone seems to escape to on days like today when it gets super hot. I'm hoping to get out there soon, as the scenery looks amazing. Here's a link to the <a href="https://www.google.si/search?q=ista+vintgar&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA696CA696&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8tZPQu-zNAhVLwBQKHWz0DJ8Q_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=719#tbm=isch&amp;q=iski+vintgar">images</a> from google.</p><p>- Kamnik and the Alps. A town north of the capital city that is built at the foot of the Alps and has some amazing hiking.</p><p>- Skofja Loka. Another small town with a lot of history that looks pretty incredible.</p><p>As you can see there are no shortage of places and that is just the start of a very long list.</p><p><strong>Photos</strong></p><p>We are in the process of uploading photos to Raeleen's Flickr account <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rae-j09/">here</a>. The ones that we've uploaded so far are from Iceland only. More will be coming and we will be putting them up on this site soon. For now please enjoy them at her Flickr page. If you have any questions or concerns, issues with the site please let me know and I'll try to address it. We did have someone say the font was harder to read so please let me know if anyone else has an issue.</p><p>Nasvidenje!
