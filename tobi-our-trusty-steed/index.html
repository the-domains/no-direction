data-reactid="53"><p>When I last updated everyone on the day to day mundane-ness of our lives, we were working to secure a car in our new home country. Well, the struggle is over! Praise the heavens and count our lucky stars.</p><p>After trying to contact, what felt like, every car owner in Slovenia we actually received two responses to our inquiries. One was from a town in the north of Slovenia called Jesenice (Pronounced: Yes a neets eh) and the other from Kranj (pronounced: Kraun) which is 30ish minutes northwest of the capital. Both were definitely out of walking/biking distance, though, which posed an issue for us. After speaking with both owners it was decided that we’d try the one in Kranj first. The owner was a younger Mormon woman who said she and her parents would be willing to pick us up at the train station and drive us around out there when we came to take a look at the vehicle. It turns out that Sarah, the current owner, was leaving the country to do her Missions for the LDS church and so needed to sell her car. The car in question is a 1999 VW Polo. Now, they do not make Polo’s for the North American market but we had rented one our last time in Europe and it seemed to have a very good mix of enough power to do the job and comfort/size to not make the trip uncomfortable.</p><picture>

<p>I have to state, first, that the price tag of the Polo was the big attraction. At only 350 euros, my Mennonite eyes almost lit up as I thought about the potential savings. We still had to worry about registration, insurance, gas, and a vignette (more on this later) and so any potential savings on the price was a big plus! The first impression was not great; she had rust and not a small amount of it, no power steering, no AC, and small 13in tires. However, the pluses came out in a big way. She drove beautifully, low kilometers for the age, more than enough space for the two of us and a manual transmission that Raeleen can learn to drive standard on without fear of destroying a nice car, haha. We thought it over for the night, took a look at a few more ads for other vehicles and ultimately came back to the Polo. The owners were amazing to deal with and we spent more than a few hours at their house with them giving us tips on what to see in the country, telling us to call them if we needed help with the car, and helping us get our registration and insurance completed. It was an awesome experience dealing with them and reassured me that we had made the right decision. We even managed to coax them down in price to 200 euros! With the keys switching hands, Sarah had one last request for us; she had named the car Toby and asked us to honor the name as it was her first vehicle. With a request like that, we couldn’t deny it. We informed her that we usually name our vehicles after girls’ names so we would make it Tobi with an ‘I’! I’d imagine that our Tobi would sign her ‘I’ with a little heart over it, but after seeing how our car presents herself to the world I’m guessing she’s more of a tomboy at heart.</p><p>Note: The Vignette is the toll system that the Slovenes use to drive on their highways. They replaced their toll booths a few years back and now if you want to use their major highways you must purchase one of these Vignettes for about 100 euro a year.</p><p><strong>When in Slovenia, do as the Slovenes do</strong></p><picture>

<p>With our trusty steed in her new stable we were invited to go with a new Slovene friend to a small lake south of the city for a swim. On arrival, we learned that Slovene’s like to use the term ‘lake’ rather broadly as this was no more than a small swimming hole. However, it was still an awesome experience with a large restaurant right behind, the green hills surrounding us on almost all sides, and lots of places to dive right in. It may have only been about 50-100 meters across but we were told that it was 60 meters deep! All in all, it was a memorable day with lots of time to lounge and just enjoy the sun and water.</p><picture>

<p><strong>The Name’s Bourne, Jason Bourne</strong></p><p>For the last couple weeks we had been looking forward to heading up to the castle above the city for a part of their summer festival that they call Movie Under the Stars. The movies are hosted in the inner courtyard of the castle with a big screen set up, well, underneath the stars. Tickets were only 4.50 euro and they gave out free ice cream, which of course made Raeleen really happy. This was the last movie for the summer and it turned out to be the brand new Jason Bourne movie.

At only 350 euros, my Mennonite eyes almost lit up as I thought about the potential savings. We still had to worry about registration, insurance, gas, and a vignette (more on this later) and so any potential savings on the price was a big plus! The first impression was not great; she had rust and not a small amount of it, no power steering, no AC, and small 13in tires. However, the pluses came out in a big way. She drove beautifully, low kilometers for the age, more than enough space for the two of us and a manual transmission that Raeleen can learn to drive standard on without fear of destroying a nice car, haha. We thought it over for the night, took a look at a few more ads for other vehicles and ultimately came back to the Polo. The owners were amazing to deal with and we spent more than a few hours at their house with them giving us tips on what to see in the country, telling us to call them if we needed help with the car, and helping us get our registration and insurance completed. It was an awesome experience dealing with them and reassured me that we had made the right decision. We even managed to coax them down in price to 200 euros! With the keys switching hands, Sarah had one last request for us; she had named the car Toby and asked us to honor the name as it was her first vehicle. With a request like that, we couldn’t deny it. We informed her that we usually name our vehicles after girls’ names so we would make it Tobi with an ‘I’! I’d imagine that our Tobi would sign her ‘I’ with a little heart over it, but after seeing how our car presents herself to the world I’m guessing she’s more of a tomboy at heart.","_html":"<p>I have to state, first, that the price tag of the Polo was the big attraction.
