I've been reminded over and over again about how lucky we are to be doing what we're doing. There are things, though, that I just can't seem to get out of my head. One of these things is our bank account slowly on a downward trend. I mean, it's not like we are in any danger of not being able to finish the trip, but it's disconcerting to see the trend. When we first started talking about this trip we realized that there were issues with our spending habits in Canada that needed to change and so, for the last two years, we tried to cut every expense where we could and it showed. Our mindset was completely changed. Things that we would not have questioned purchasing originally were now things that we did without. I made it a habit to know our finances and to watch how things were going on the savings front. Now though, everything is completely backwards. It's not only what's happening, it's EXPECTED that our account is only going to go in one direction for the foreseeable future and it's been driving me a bit crazy. It's been a bit of a relearning again, to actually spend what we've saved and to realize that building the memory is the point of our trip and not on how to do it as cheaply as possible. With that in mind, we decided not to hold ourselves back in finding new experiences. It is still a struggle to actually spend that money but this trip is a good first step on loosening those purse strings that I have wound so tightly over the last 2 years.

### The Soca River Valley
![Just outside of Bovec, Slovenia](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/435d5ab2-e8ed-4dc3-97f4-bb273e50a644.jpg)

One area of Slovenia that we missed out on the last time we were here was the Soca (Pronounced: So-cha) River Valley. This famous area of the country is perfect for the thrill-seekers and the history buffs. With beautiful blue rivers, super high mountains, waterfalls aplenty, and more sights than you can shake a stick at, it was an easy choice for our first extended sightseeing trip. It is also part of the 'Walk of Peace', which is a 220km hike from the Italian Dolomites down to the Adriatic sea; the trail passes through many of the battlefronts of the Isonzo front of WWI and straddles the border between Slovenia and Italy. The front was a massive area for confrontation with incredibly heated mountaintop battles. Over half of all Italian losses in all of WWI happened on this front alone, so it was pretty sobering to be able to see all of the amazing WWI history that is so well preserved in the towns and villages in this area. In total there were 1.2 million dead in the battles of the Isonzo.

Napoleon also had a heavy presence in this area and it is still easy to see, as well, with numerous preserved fortifications.

We decided it was easiest to do a big circle starting in the north and then travelling through the Soca and back to Ljubljana from the west. This circle meant travelling quickly into Italy for an hour or two and then back into Slovenia through Bovec (pronounced: Bovets). Expecting the worst with the borders in Europe at the moment we brought all paperwork just to ensure no issues. It appears we were a bit over prepared, though, as the Italians (and Slovenians for that matter) took a rather Italian approach to border control between the two countries. We barely even knew we had moved into the next country before we started to realize that there were a lot more Italian license plates and signs were no longer in Slovene.

We spent most of the morning at a lake in Italy called Lago del Predil. It was extremely beautiful with WWI forts surrounding the lake along with many Italians flailing their arms in what we can only assume to be heated discussions, but in the end was probably no more than talk about their daily routine.

Heading up the pass between the two countries we quietly moved back into Slovenia through another unguarded border post and found ourselves in front of a fort from Napoleon's time. Commissioned by the same man whose assassination would spark WWI, Franz Ferdinand. It seems you can't turn around in this area without looking at some sort of fort, bunker, or other heavily fortified area. In fact, there are still many areas that you can hike to and find trenches, fortifications, daily items from a soldiers life, and even bodies from an era long gone. Even in recent years, news of WWI soldiers bodies being uncovered by melting glaciers has been an occurrence that you would not expect.

Fort after fort seemed to drive home the point of just how important an area this was 100 years ago for the Austro-Hungarians and the Italians. Walking through these areas was extremely sobering but also awe-inspiring, as the thought of having to build these fortresses with the resources they had at the time would have been next to impossible.

Often, the only access was by path dug straight through a mountain or Via Ferrata.

Down in Bovec, we were able to take a look at the amazing scenery all around. People canyoning through the many gorges, skydiving, rock climbing, kayaking, whitewater rafting; it seems like an extreme sports heaven. When looking for accommodation we realized that we may have waited too long, as our list of places to stay was quite short. We did manage to find a place eventually that for some reason was quite large, and very nice but cheaper by quite a bit. Unsure why, we booked it and waited for our night. Only when we arrived did we realize WHY it was priced the way it was as we again needed to drive up steep mountain roads 8 km into areas I wasn't sure our little car should be taking us. It did amazingly though, and we had incredible views and new ideas about what to do for our next trip out to this area. The apartment owner was also the first person we met that not only knew of Red Deer but had lived in Edmonton. It was surprising to say the least.

We spent the rest of this trip admiring waterfalls, swimming in the beautiful rivers, and just loving life in general.

While Raeleen was doing her thing with the camera, I needed to see what trouble I could get myself into. At one of the waterfalls I found a Via Ferrata on the wall of the mountain that took you above the waterfall and up to a second pool. Against my better judgement and my increasing aversion to heights (which seems to be getting worse as I get older), I climbed up with sweaty hands cursing myself every step of the way...and was rewarded with a less than stellar view. Oh $%^\#, now I have to go down.

We found in the end, that we did not have enough time in this area and we will surely be back for more.

### Celje (Pronounced: Tsel-Yay)
![Overlooking Celje from the Castle](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fda4a9fe-4114-49da-b10d-fd602cb4d036.jpg)

Hearing from our friend that this city in eastern Slovenia was really quite lovely we made a decision to head here for a day. Although the weather was less than ideal, we made our way up to the castle that overlooks the city and were rewarded with an amazing sunset coupled with some very spooky clouds that flowed like water through the hills surrounding the city.

This area is also full of Roman ruins and the many museums and archaeological sites proved the rich history of the area.

### Tobi's Limit

We have managed to find the peak of what we are able to put our car through. On one of our recent excursions for hiking with one of our Slovene friends, Domen, we left the city early in the morning heading for the foothills. "Which route do you want?" Domen asked, "The direct or the motorway?" Pfftt, what fun is the motorway, I thought. "Let's go direct". It would appear that this decision may have been ill advised. It amazes me every day what I find driving through Slovenia. Even in countryside that looks like rolling hills you can run into something you would never expect...like a 20 plus degree downhill for a long period of time. There was no ability to use downshifting as a way to slow our descent...it was just too steep. Minutes later as we sat beside our poor Tobi, smoke billowing from the brakes, we resolved to not push her so hard anymore. Let's just say that she will now have an appointment with a service center to ensure we did no real damage. The hiking was otherwise uneventful, but gorgeous as always. Domen has been an amazing source of knowledge of the country and a good friend. We value him so much and count ourselves lucky to have met him.

### Down the Road

There will be more posts coming, as we have just returned from the Istrian Peninsula. We've also managed to make a few new friends and feel like we have a bit more normal life now. We had hoped to get language lessons provided by the state for the first 60 hours, but it seems that the visa we have is one of the few that does not permit this for temporary residents. It is a bit of a blow and definitely a setback but I do still hope that we learn enough to get by before we leave. We have learned a few small things but we quickly revert to English in all situations. I have taken to watching cartoons in Slovene when I can and watching movies but reading the subtitles. I doubt it has helped and I'm sure I butcher pronunciations when I say them but I guess the learning is all a part of it.

Raeleen has also posted more photos to her Flickr account [here][0]. She was very excited to see that one of the pictures on her account got "Explored" which means it's put into a rotation of the best new pictures on Flickr for that day. This brought her a few more followers, 3000 more views of the picture in question and a big boost to her confidence I'm sure.

And finally, about a month ago Raeleen was also invited to an international photo workshop in Krakow, Poland. She received an email through the Flickr website from a group, [Let Me Italian You][1], inviting her to participate in a monthly workshop to expose the beauty of Krakow through the eyes of amateur photographers as well as to learn from professionals. She is extremely excited to be a part of this and so we will be leaving for Poland in a week.
