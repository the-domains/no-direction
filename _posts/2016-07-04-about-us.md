Raeleen is the photographer and you can check out some of her current work on her flickr profile [here.][0] She is a big fan of landscape photography and would love to do this for a living in the future. If you are looking to purchase some of her current work please contact us for specifics at raeleenjanzen@yahoo.com.

Matt is the 'writer'. He uses that term very loosely as he wants to be a better writer but honestly, is just not that good at it. His proofreader (Rae) ensures everything makes sense.
