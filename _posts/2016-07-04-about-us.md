  Raeleen and Matt are travellers from Red Deer, Alberta. Our love of travel has
  taken us to a number of locations around the world. Our current number of
  countries visited is around 20. With large plans in the future to greatly
  increase this number, we decided that we needed to become more serious about
  our travelling.  We believe that travel is an important part of life and makes
  you a more rounded person. Not only able to understand other cultures but just
  other positions and beliefs which we believe is important in being a good
  traveller/person in general.

# About Us

Raeleen and Matt are travellers from Red Deer, Alberta. Our love of travel has taken us to a number of locations around the world. Our current number of countries visited is around 20\. With large plans in the future to greatly increase this number, we decided that we needed to become more serious about our travelling. We believe that travel is an important part of life and makes you a more rounded person. Not only able to understand other cultures but just other positions and beliefs which we believe is important in being a good traveller/person in general. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b4e47bee-e773-45cf-b642-553f460a3158.jpg)

Raeleen is the photographer and you can check out some of her current work on her flickr profile [here.][0] She is a big fan of landscape photography and would love to do this for a living in the future. If you are looking to purchase some of her current work please contact us for specifics at raeleenjanzen@yahoo.com.

Matt is the 'writer'. He uses that term very loosely as he wants to be a better writer but honestly, is just not that good at it. His proofreader (Rae) ensures everything makes sense.
