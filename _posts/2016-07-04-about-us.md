# About Us

Raeleen and Matt are travellers from Red Deer, Alberta. Our love of travel has taken us to a number of locations around the world. Our current number of countries is around 20 and we are hoping to expand on that. We believe that travel is an important part of life and makes you a more rounded person. Not only able to understand other cultures but just other positions and beliefs which is important in being a good person. 

Raeleen is the photographer of us both and you can check out some of her current work on her flickr profile [here.][0] She is a big fan of landscape photography and would love to do this for a living in the future. If you are looking to purchase some of her current work please contact us for specifics. 

Matt is the 'writer'. He uses that term very loosely as he wants to be a better writer but honestly, is just not that good at it. His proofreader (Rae) ensures everything makes sense.
