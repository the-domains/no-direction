**The point of no return...**

For the past 2 or 3 years Raeleen and I have talked about moving to another country. It started off as jokes about how the vacations we were taking just didn't give us the time we wanted in our location. We would inevitably return from every single vacation and say to each other "I could see myself living there one day". I imagine its something that everyone does...the grass is always greener and all that right? 

**Making it a reality**

About a year and a half ago we started to talk about it a bit more seriously. Our conversations weren't just 'what ifs'. They started to become conversations about where in the world we still wanted to see, did we think we could actually live in a certain location, and are we doing this on a permanent basis or was this something we just wanted to test with for a year. Originally, the plan was to move to Germany for a year and take German lessons. We had visited friends in the Black Forest and fell in love with the south of the country. It was what we wanted; quaint towns, lots of history, and the time we thought we needed to get a hold on the German language. 

**Zdravo!**

Eventually the conversation turned to Slovenia. We both agreed that we wanted to see more of the Balkans. We started to do a bit more research about the possibilities and when we discovered that Slovenia offered a Youth Mobility Visa 'til age 35 it was pretty much decided. The costs would be a bit lower by living in that part of the world, we wouldn't get as harsh of a winter, and we still would have the opportunity to learn another language if we wanted. The language barrier is very harsh, though, as all we've seen/heard about Slovene is that it is quite hard for an English speaker to learn. I have a feeling that Rae may do better in this area than I as she seems to have the ability to carry through with things she starts, whereas I tend to get discouraged.

With our location decided and my youthful good looks ensuring our visa acceptance under their Youth Mobility Program we started our planning. Let me remind you all that if you ever decide to move after living in a house for an extended period of time, it's much easier to just burn it all to the ground and take the insurance money! With much stress, swearing, and drinking we finished our move out and are now living like hobo's in my brother's basement. We definitely could not have done this all without the help of Rae's family and mine and we definitely appreciate all they've helped us with. 

**The Devil is in the Details.**

As of Tuesday, our home address will change significantly. The Slovene Government has accepted us and as far as I'm concerned there's no takesies-backsies. Now there's just the matter of all the things I'm sure we've forgotten to sort out. Hopefully none of them are too important and we can make due without. At this point we're still without a place to stay after the 12th of July in Slovenia. As concerning as this is to me right now, Rae did come up with the great idea of just travelling around for the month of July to other areas and then just getting a place for August 1st. The more I think about it, the more I do like this idea and there are certain things I want to see right away, Sarajevo (the old Olympics site), Foroglio, Switzerland (seriously, look it up), and the eastern parts of Slovenia. So, if it continues as it has currently and we are unable to secure an apartment for July 12th there may be a bit more travelling in our immediate future. 

That should give everyone a good starting point for our trip. If there's any questions please ask. I'll try and keep this as up to date as possible. Let me know if there's anything you want to see/hear about and I'll do my best to accommodate. Our friend Dar has told us she will be issuing us challenges throughout our year so some posts may involve the highlights of these challenges. Hope you all enjoy!
