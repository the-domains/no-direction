Thing's I've learned so far about living in Slovenia:

1\. Beer is cheap...but wine is even cheaper! Time to switch to wine!!!

2\. The language is daunting but it must at least appear that we're native since we get addressed constantly in Slovene. At least this gives me a bit of hope.

3\. All forms of judging how long it will take to drive somewhere are completely out the window here! 21 km's today took us around 30 minutes. I guess that's what you get when the road is only wide enough for one car and constantly winding back and forth.

4\. Raeleen and I both get car sick from the constantly winding roads.

5\. 70 km/hr feels like travelling at LIGHT SPEED on a windy road. However, even if you feel like it's impossible to go any faster a native Slovene WILL catch you and blow past you as if you're doing 30\.

6\. Road guardrails are used only in MILDLY dangerous parts where the hill is sloping gently. No guardrails or protections are saved for situations where there is a sheer drop of no less than 500 feet. I'm assuming this is the Slovene method of weeding out their bad drivers ;) It's like a Darwinian system of Natural Selection for bad drivers...with very extreme endings. Please see \#5...the ones that 'make it' all seem to be extremely competent at the driving needed in this country.

7\. All Slovene's seem to go out of their way to be helpful and friendly.

8\. Slovene's all seem to have a huge love affair with cycling. No matter where you are, how high, low, or in between, you will be passing people constantly on their bikes. I still can't get over some of the stuff they bike up and proclaim that it's fun. I'm gonna borrow a line from John Pinette here. "I don't do 'UPs'. Get up, stand up, walk up, bike up. I do down's. Lie down, double down, get down, boogie down." Put me on a bike on a huge downhill like that and I'm all game...but I'm sure as hell driving to the top of that hill first.

9\. Everyone seems to be in good physical shape and will talk about eating healthy, doing lots of physical exercise, etc. 2 minutes later they will have a cigarette in their mouth. This is one contradiction that brings a smile to my face every time. I think that North America is ahead here in terms of turning people off of smoking and keeping public gathering areas smoke free and really do appreciate that more now.

10\. Struklji (pronounced: Strew-klee) is AMAZING!!! I cannot stress this enough. It's a Slovene dish that seems to be prepared various ways but kind of resembles perogies. We've had it twice so far, one at the tourist farms stuffed with fresh cheese, and served with sugar, honey?, and berries of some kind. The second was also amazing but still can't compare to the first ones. This one was made with a walnut mash and raisins and then topped with sweets (the sugar and honey I think) again. Both times they have been served warm.

10\. And finally, all Slovene's show a lot of pride in their country. When they find out we chose Slovenia they can't help but say that they think 'we made a good choice' in coming to Slovenia. We tend to agree.

**Hiking Mt. Stol**
![At the start of the hike.  Mt Stol is on the top right. ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/18d1fb62-3725-407a-a8cd-686a15d5b6cc.jpg)

We had decided shortly after meeting our new French Canadian friend, Justine, that we wanted to do a hike together. After a few days of planning, Justine sent us a message saying that we should hike Mt. Stol. One of the other people in her Hostel had recently finished it and highly recommended it. As the highest mountain in the Karavanke range at 2236m, we knew that it would be a big one but the website said the hike was moderate to hard and about 1200m of elevation gain.

Picking up Justine and our new Czech friend Lukas (sorry Lukas, don't know how to add the accents on top of the letters here) we made our way to the mountain. Reaching the starting point of the hike, we got our first hint that things may not be as they seem. The starting post for the hike says 2.5 hours to the top of Mt Stol... hmmm, not too bad. 15 minutes of hiking later and we reach another post. The post now says top of Mt Stol is 3 hours... uh...ok. Undeterred, we continued on with a very steady climb. Within 30 minutes we were rewarded with the most amazing views of the valley floor, Lake Bled, and the surrounding towns. The higher we got, the more we get to see; the Sava River, Triglav National Park and its mountain range. This was definitely a good first introduction to the hiking here.

3 hours later we made the top...or so we thought. We quickly discovered it was a false peak and the true peak was another 15 minutes. Finally at the top we enjoyed our victory beer and peered over the backside into Austria (this mountain range is part of the diving line between Austria and Slovenia).

We had meant to hit up this area of the country when we were last here in 2014 but just did not have the time. It is said to have Slovenia's most beautiful valleys and is sparsely populated and very farming oriented. The people in this area are very proud of their high mountain plateau's and farms and have made a bit of a business out of having Tourist Farms where you can stay, sleep, eat, and even help with the chores if you so please. This means lots of extremely high roads with insanely amazing views that you don't even have to work for unless you consider white knuckling your steering wheel on the drive up a workout. I'm sure I was sweating more on these drives than I ever did in any gym.

We started the day with a visit to Cuc (pronounced: Tsuts) waterfall. We were just in time to catch a group of canyoners going down it. Definitely something I'm going to be trying out.

After Cuc we continued on with our regular plans and moved into the valley of Robanov Kot and then into the high mountain roads to see the high alpine farms.

As nervous as I was about the driving, Tobi just refused to quit and performed amazingly. We eventually gave her a break up top for some time in the sun.

The whole area was just awe inspiring and we couldn't help but keep the camera going on overdrive. Every single corner was reason to stop the car and get out to stretch the legs, take a few pictures and stroll through the large green high alpine meadows.

After the high alpine meadows we visited Logarska Dolina, said to be Slovenia's most beautiful valley. You can see it in the picture below as we looked down on it from upon high. The valley is also in the first picture of this post.

We ended the day with a trip to the second highest waterfall in Slovenia. All in all, it was a good but tiring day. I look forward to heading back, though, to do more exploring in this area as there were definitely things we missed such as the canyoning in the many gorges and rivers.
