# **A Tale of Two...Perpetually Sweaty Travellers **

So it's been a few days since we've last spoken...or at least since I've last talked at you and you've had to sit there and like it! Please like!?!? And well, things have been going pretty well so far for us. Our plans are starting to fall into place and for the first time since we've been here we've actually had the chance to do something OUTSIDE of the city. Now don't get me wrong, Ljubljana (pronounced: Lee-yoob-lee-yana) is a beautiful city but it is also a smaller city which means that you start to see the same things over and over again very quickly. I also just have to mention that it appears that the earth must have a massive bulge right under this part of the world as it feels like we are MUCH closer to the sun than we should be. I've never been this hot and sweaty for such an extended period of time. Darkness doesn't seem to save you, as then its merely dark and hot with a mix of high humidity thrown in to really make it pleasant while you try and peel your clothing away from your drenched skin. I'm currently upping my shower routine to 2-3 a day in an effort to keep the smell down. Not sure on how that war is going just yet as I still usually have to change partway through the day.

(I'm sorry Kel-cie, I know that you wanted some pronunciations added with the Slovene places and words but I can't say that line up there either so we'll both have to just assume that it's home sweet home in English and try to butcher the pronunciations in private. I can say that the j is a y sound, so that may help for the first part.) Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.We have managed to secure an apartment in an area of the city called Šiška (pronounced: Shishka). The area is in the northwestern part of the city and has some pretty amazing views of the Kamnik Alps on clear days. With this large hurdle out of the way, we realized that we were missing many day to day things which meant spending more money. This also means that our monthly budget has been thrown way out of whack as we try to make up for all the things that we are missing. I know that a few people had mentioned they wanted to see how much we spent per month so I think for August I am going to do a very detailed breakdown of our expenditures so you can see what the costs of living are like for us here.

**IŠKI VINTGAR**

I had spoken about this place last week and now that we finally had a place to stay, we felt it was time to leave the city. Iški Vintgar is a gorge just south of the city with a small river running through it with lots of interesting rock formations, caves, and quite pleasant temperatures even when it's blistering hot outside. It seems to be the place to escape to for the Slovene's when it gets too hot out. We discovered through a helpful Slovene that a city bus took us almost all the way there. Waiting for the hottest day of the week, we got up early on Wednesday and jumped on the bus. After the last stop on the bus-line we disembarked and started our 3.5km walk to the gorge itself. It was 9am and was already 25 celsius. I do not do well in the sun and figured with Slovenia being as safe as it is, it was time to do something I had always wanted. Ever so nervous, my thumb went up as the first car passed; nothing. Hmm. My thoughts started swirling...it must be Raeleen...yeah, yeah, that's it. No one is going to want to pick up that magnificent piece of meat if they know that it's already been bought. I tried again, this time with a bit of separation between Raeleen and I (all done conspicuously of course)...same result...dammit. At this point we had been walking for quite some time in the sun and were quite sweaty. With the beads of sweat glistening on her forehead, Rae shot out her thumb and the first car stopped; "darn...I'll never hear the end of this". The driver quickly told us, laughing, that we were only about 5 minutes walk away from the entrance. Arriving at our destination with our new friend we parted ways and headed into the gorge.

The gorge itself was beautiful with a small, shallow stream running through it.

Climbing walls popped up here and there and Slovene's were around every corner already staking their claims on the abundant shallow and deeper clear water pools that marked every 20-30 meters.

After getting lost, cliff jumping into deeper pools, and napping beside the stream it was finally time to go back to the city. We did not want to do that walk again and so for the second time in our lives we again hitchhiked. This time it did not take nearly so long as we had barely left the park by the time we were picked up by two guys; an off-duty police officer and his friend. They were incredibly nice and ended up driving us all the way back to the city all the while talking our ears off about things we needed to see while in Slovenia and Europe, differences between western and eastern cultures, the Yugoslav war, the Middle East, and giving us advice on purchasing a vehicle. They ended up dropping us off three blocks from our apartment but not before inviting us out for a supper and some drinks which we accepted. It was nice to get to know these two and we made sure to grab their contact information. My first and second experiences with hitchhiking have taught me a few things; that people are for the most part good and kind, and that a smile and a laugh go a long way no matter the language. We actually ended up also meeting a British couple that had just started a trip for the next 18 months, travelling wherever their hearts took them. We sat with them and talked for an hour or so and really enjoyed their company. They told us about their experiences so far hiking in Spain, their time in Italy and plans to come. It's these kinds of experiences that reassure me that we made the right decision to come here. We traded contact information, and a trip to Manchester may be in the cards for us somewhere down the road.

**Work Permits**

I was sure that this was going to be one of those things that always caused a problem. We'd get it almost sorted out and then it would slip out of our fingers, but rather anticlimactically our work permits appeared in our email inbox today and so we are now able to legally work...although at the moment, I have a feeling these won't get much use. With that done, we're almost completely setup here in Slovenia. It's been an experience so far and hopefully by next week we can introduce you to the Janzen Jalopy. Until then, hope you enjoyed reading this.
