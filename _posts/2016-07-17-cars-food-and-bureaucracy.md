# **Cars, Food, and Bureaucracy **

The last couple of days have been a bit of a blur, to be honest. We haven't really DONE a whole lot, as the process of getting into an apartment seems to dominate all we do. As the title implies, we've seen a couple of cool things, eaten some good food and dealt with the bureaucracy you seem to find in most countries around the world.

This week we were walking around the central core and noticed that there were a ton of people lined up in the main walking only area, and for some reason there were a lot of older cars driving around. We quickly discovered that the city square was the finish line for the leg of a race called Peking to Paris. Although I don't know much about it, the race seems to be an endurance rally that starts, as stated, in Peking and ends in Paris. People seem to use these older cars to make the legs of each part of the race. We got to witness some of the first cars driving into the main square and crossing the finish line for the day. It was a pretty cool experience and one that the city seemed to love as it was packed!

**Food**

On Friday, we also got to experience Ljubljana's version of Food Truck Fridays and they do it in style! Apparently every Friday of the summer, some of the best international and local restaurants in Slovenia gather in one of the squares for what they call 'Odprta kuhna' which means, Open kitchen. The place was packed when we arrived, and with all the amazing choices, it wasn't hard to see why! We tried some Thai and Indian dishes this time, but I'm sure we'll sample more options before the summer is through. We were a little concerned before we got here that the international cuisines that we enjoy might be a little bit hard to find, but that really doesn't seem to be the case, much to our relief.

**Bureaucracy**

The bureaucracy, on the other hand, has definitely been a pain in the ass. I expected this, to be honest, but to see it in action and have it happen to us is something I was hoping against. We still are not entirely sure about all the little things that we are required to do. We found out after we got here that we had to be assigned a tax number. This part was easy; heading to our first building, walking in, handing over our information and walking out with our tax number about 20 minutes later. Sweet! Maybe it will all be this easy right? HA! Next up was the work permit. I mentioned that we had tried for this last week already but had not been able to get it figured out. Well, this week we finally managed to find the ACTUAL building where we could get them, however, after discussing our situation with 3 different people we were still no closer to figuring out how to get the permits. The problem, it seems, is that the visa's we have are used so rarely (less than 5 a year) that even the staff were unsure on how to proceed. We have been told that they will get back to us with the information, but I hold out little hope and expect to have to make the trip out there again. YAY!

**Our New Home! Maybe?**

The one huge upside of all of this past week has been that we BELIEVE we have secured an apartment. It's in the northwestern part of the city, about 2 minutes walk from Tivoli Park, which is a MASSIVE park in the city of Ljubljana. Opening the windows reveals a beautiful view of the Kamnik Alps. It's only one bedroom and for a bit more than we expected to pay. The last few apartments we had seen, though, had not wowed us at all and we felt like we may have to settle...as soon as we saw this one, though, we knew it was the right choice. The main issue here is that the landlord doesn't seem to speak a whole lot of English so it's been real fun trying to figure out exactly what they need from us and how we go about paying our rent/bills/etc. Here's where our first AirBnB hosts have stepped up yet again. After hearing about our issues, our host, Gasper, insisted on calling for us to clear up any issues and while on the phone, told our landlord that if there were any further issues to just call him and he would relay the message to us. Just amazing and we owe them so much for all the help! That about brings us up to today. The last 3 days have been cold and rainy; cold being around +20 celsius. I've been loving it honestly, it makes it feel more like home and it's been the first day I could wear bluejeans and full shoes. Next week is forecasted to be very hot again, though, so we will be heading out of the city for the first time and we're both quite excited. Anyways, I feel like this post has been a bit lacking as it's just been day to day stuff for the past few days. Hopefully I'll have more to discuss early next week for you all!

On a final note, Rae has uploaded a couple more photos to her flickr account [here][0].
