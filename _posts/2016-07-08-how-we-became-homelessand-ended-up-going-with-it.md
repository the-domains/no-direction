# **How we became homeless...and ended up going with it.**

With what we believe to be enough money saved up to last us for a year, we decided that we wanted to experience life a bit differently. Although I'm sure that we're not the first people to quit our jobs and travel, I know that our choice is not a common one. I know that this choice may not be the right one for everyone, I'm not even sure that this is the right choice for us, but after talking about it for years I know that if we didn't at least try, we'd never find out for sure.

**Iceland; heading to another planet without ever leaving Earth.**

We arrived in Iceland at 6:30 am on July 6th. We had expected to be able to sleep on the flight from Edmonton to Reykjavik. But what we expect and what actually happens almost never seem to agree. I got caught up in a new series called Mr. Robot and Raeleen was busy watching The Revenant on IcelandAir's in-flight entertainment system. This was a HUGE mistake. Iceland though, did not disappoint and tried its hardest to wow us at every turn. With our trusty rental car and its moped-like engine we made our way around the 'Golden Circle'.

Only having time to stop at the most traveled tourist sites made us a bit sad but we were still excited for the opportunity to at least scratch the surface of Iceland. We found out very quickly that it is one of the most bizarre landscapes we've ever seen. At one point you believe you're on another planet, and then 5 minutes later you're in the most lush/green rolling hills you've ever seen. The drive from the airport to Reykjavik is incredible with almost no trees and volcanic rock as far as the eye can see. After Reykjavik you climb massive hills and on the other side is fertile farmland with tons of farms dotting the landscape. Hardy Icelandic horses are everywhere, along with tractors on the roads and multitudes of farmers in the fields. What I thought I would see, and what Iceland was were close at the start, but became very different after Reykjavik. This disconnect more than once almost caused us to miss the site we were looking for. The country's ability to hide its attractions is astounding. One second you're in farmland, the next you take a small turn onto what looks to be a farmer's land and you're looking at a massive tectonic rift with waterfalls/geysers.

Starting with Oxararfoss, in Thingvellir National Park we took a small hike to the waterfall and a few other small sites around the park. What we didn't realize was just how horrible the black flies would be. I started out praying to God that they would leave me alone. When that didn't work I started praying to multiple gods, Odin, Freya, Loki. They, too, were unable to satiate the appetites of the flies. In that small hike I contemplated suicide multiple times. I can see now why Iceland has so few people as I'm sure the rest of the population has been either killed and eaten by the black flies or given up for sacrifice to this menace. Seriously though, this site is beautiful and more pictures will be uploaded shortly after Raeleen edits some of the pictures from her camera. For now, the pics from her cellphone will have to do. Next on the list was Geysir, a site with multiple natural geysers one of which shoots at least 100 feet into the air about every 2-3 minutes. Surprisingly, they allow people very close even with the temperature of the water in the Geysers at 100 celsius and over. Thankfully the sulfur smell of rotten eggs and a light breeze kept the black flies mostly away and we were able to enjoy the view. About this time, we started to embrace our hobo lifestyle a bit more readily. Having had only 1 hour of sleep, the exhaustion started to hit us hard. It was here at Geysir that we made our first decision to have a quick nap in our rental car in the parking lot. We did this 2 more times throughout our time in Iceland and although it was regrettable with the amount of time we wasted sleeping, it was for the best as I don't think I could have made the drive safely otherwise. Raeleen definitely could not drive it as we wanted to be able to return the car with the transmission still firmly attached. After our quick nap we again hit the road and ventured to Gulfoss waterfall which is the largest waterfall in Europe. To say it was amazing would be an understatement. I had hoped that it would be the site from the opening of the film Prometheus and even though it wasn't, I was not disappointed.

Finally on our list was Secret Lagoon, a naturally fed pool with small, boiling geysers surrounded by farmland on all sides. I had always wanted to see Blue Lagoon in Iceland, as they have done an amazing job marketing their site, however, after doing some research I discovered a couple things: Blue Lagoon is man made and is very expensive. Secret Lagoon is all natural, old, and much less known (Does this make us Hipsters?) which meant not very busy. It just so happened to be only 15 minutes off of the main track, as well. It was everything I hoped it would be and refreshed us after not having showered for 2 days.

Our last attraction of the day was actually a bit of an accident. We had hoped to go for a late supper in Reykjavik on our way back to the airport, however, we realized we would not have enough time. Our route had already taken us into the city and right beside the famed Hallgrimskirkja Cathedral. After 30 minutes of checking out this spectacular area we quickly made our way back to the airport and said our goodbyes to Iceland.

**In Munich, but too tired for beer?**

We flew through the night yet again...and yet again did not sleep. This was now our 3rd day without substantial amounts of sleep and we were in Munich which means beer for all, right?! I think its some sort of requirement by the German authorities, isn't it? I told Raeleen when we arrived that I needed sleep so we headed to our favorite green spot in Munich, Hofgarten. There, I again embraced my hobo roots and slept for a few hours in the grass while Raeleen enjoyed the sun. After waking up, though, I felt so cloudy and slow to respond that I dared not have any beer for fear of what it would do to me. Walking past the Hofbrauhaus without going in may have been my biggest struggle to date. I vowed to comeback and right these wrongs I had committed to the Bavarian state.

**The metamorphosis is complete?**

We arrived in Ljubljana at 8:30 pm on Thursday, July 7th. We quickly met the owners of our temporary rental and once settled in, we fell asleep; thankful for a bed for the first time in almost 3 days. Waking up with a hunger the likes of which I hope to never have again, we walked until we discovered a decent looking place with a nice patio; lots of tables and chairs setup outside to enjoy the hot weather and lots of patrons. We walked in and after the first person trying to address us realized we don't speak Slovene she handed us off to another cook. I'll never forget his first words and the look on Raeleen's face as he said "Welcome to the Ljubljana Humanitarian kitchen". As it dawned on us both that we were about to eat lunch in a soup kitchen we both had very different reactions. Raeleen looked like she wanted to melt into the ground and disappear while I resolved to myself that this is what my life had now become and that 'ooo, those potatoes look tasty'. Realizing what we had done, we sheepishly took our food, paid our small bill and officially became a drain on the state of Slovenia. I'm sorry if any native Slovenes read this, I swear we'll try our best to make it up to you.

Raeleen will be uploading more photos tomorrow so make sure to check back for more additions to the photos category and to her flickr account [here][0].

**Challenge \#1 - The first of many.**

Our friend Darlene had issued her first challenge of what I'm assuming will be many and increasingly harder challenges. I feel like this time she took it easy on us and we were able to complete this within hours of seeing it. The challenge was to:

1\. Meet another person during our travelling period. Done!

2\. Get their Name, Job, Where they live, and who they believe will win the American election? Her name is Caroline, shes from New York, and she believes that it will be a Hillary win this year! Although I didn't realize the picture was a requirement I see now that it was. I will make this up to you in some form and didn't try to skimp on this on purpose.
